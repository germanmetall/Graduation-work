# Graduation work
My grad'work from LIT. 2017 year, 11-G-2 form

Y'know, we must do a grad'work in the 11th form of LIT. It was such hard for everyone, but some of us got very good exp from this task.

So, my project has been written with the help of WPF in VS'17 and MS Office Accept. It got the name "Mendeleev's Table and Physical Ð¡haracteristics of Elements". My project shows the Mendeleev's table, table with some characteristics, alpha and beta decays.

I got 10/12 =)
